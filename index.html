        <h2>Part 1: Data Audit & Integrity</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 1: Is our data sufficient to support conclusions about 'speculative behavior'? What are its limitations?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 1: The Data Void</h3>
        <div class="chart-metadata">
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Bar Chart.</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> Shows the proportion of missing values for the Flip Horizon attribute.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <span class="highlight">"67% of the flip data is missing; therefore, we cannot solely rely on 'holding period' and must pivot to analyzing 'buyer identity'."</span></p>
        </div>
        <img src="1.png" alt="Chart 1: The Data Void">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p>In the initial exploration of the A2_EDA_Residential dataset, I created a calculated field, Is_Flip_Data_Missing, to audit the integrity of the "Flip Horizon" attribute—a key metric for measuring the duration between consecutive property sales. The visualization reveals a significant data quality issue: approximately 67% of the 49,000+ residential transaction records lack this information.</p>
            <p>This high rate of missingness suggests a major limitation in the dataset's ability to track short-term speculative "flipping" behavior, as many transactions cannot be chronologically linked to a prior sale. Consequently, while the dataset remains valuable for identifying buyer types, any analysis regarding the "speed" of investment cycles must be treated as a subset rather than a comprehensive market overview. This realization shifts my focus toward "Buyer Identity" (LLC vs. Individual) as a more reliable proxy for analyzing corporate influence in the Boston housing market.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 2: The Outlier Check</h3>
        <div class="chart-metadata">
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Scatter Plot.</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> X-axis is Date, Y-axis is Price (disaggregated).</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Extreme outliers are present; subsequent price analysis must use the 'median' rather than the 'mean'."</span></p>
        </div>
        <img src="2.png" alt="Chart 2: The Outlier Check">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> A scatter plot of transaction prices over time reveals the presence of extreme outliers, with the top 1% of transactions exceeding $14.8 million and some individual sales surpassing $100 million.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> These values likely represent large-scale commercial-residential complexes rather than typical single-family homes. To prevent these luxury mega-sales from skewing the analysis of housing affordability for average residents, I will prioritize median prices over mean prices in subsequent neighborhood comparisons.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Part 2: The Macro Takeover</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 2: What fundamental changes have occurred in Boston's housing market structure over the past 20 years?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 3: The Great Divergence</h3>
        <div class="chart-metadata">
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Dual Axis Line Chart.</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> Left axis Corporate Ownership Rate, right axis Owner Occupancy Rate.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <span class="highlight">"Capital enters, residents exit. The divergence accelerates post-2020."</span></p>
        </div>
        <img src="3.png" alt="Chart 3: The Great Divergence">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This dual-axis line chart tracks the structural transformation of Boston’s housing market over the last two decades. I plotted the Corporate Ownership Rate against the Owner Occupancy Rate. The visualization reveals a striking inverse relationship: while corporate ownership has steadily climbed—accelerating noticeably after 2020—the rate of owner-occupied homes has been in a continuous decline.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The divergence of these two lines confirms a systemic "financialization" of the local housing market. The data suggests that institutional capital is competing directly with individual homebuyers, effectively displacing families from homeownership opportunities. The post-2020 spike in corporate ownership indicates that the pandemic likely created a buying opportunity for investors.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 4: The Seasonal Pulse</h3>
        <div class="chart-metadata">
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Monthly Line Chart / Radial Chart.</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> X-axis is Month, Y-axis is Number of Records, color-coded by Buyer Type.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="4.png" alt="Chart 4: The Seasonal Pulse">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This line chart compares the seasonal purchasing patterns of Corporate (LLC) buyers versus Individual buyers. Individual activity drops precipitously in the winter. In contrast, Corporate buyers remain surprisingly active in December (10.4% of their annual volume) and January, significantly outperforming the individual market trend during these months.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The data suggests that corporate capital operates with a different logic than household buyers. Investors appear to be opportunistic "bottom fishers," utilizing the winter lull to acquire properties with less competition. The December spike may also be driven by year-end tax incentives.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
        <h2>Part 3: Geography & Space</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 3: Is there a specific strategic pattern to the geographic expansion of capital in Boston?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 5: The Corporate Enclaves</h3>
        <div class="chart-metadata">
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Point Map.</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> Geolocation of transactions color-coded by Buyer Type (Red=Corporate, Gray=Individual).</p>
        </div>
        <img src="5.png" alt="Chart 5: The Corporate Enclaves">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This geospatial visualization maps every residential transaction in the dataset. While individual purchases are scattered evenly across residential suburbs, corporate acquisitions are densely clustered in specific zones—most notably the South Boston Waterfront (Seaport), Fenway, and Downtown.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The map confirms that corporate investment is highly targeted. These "red zones" correspond perfectly with Boston's "Innovation Districts" and areas of recent luxury zoning upscaling, effectively creating corporate enclaves unaffordable for traditional residential communities.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 6: Neighborhood Ranking</h3>
        <img src="6.png" alt="Chart 6: Neighborhood Ranking">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Filtering for 2024 data and ranking neighborhoods reveals a distinct geographic pattern. The South Boston Waterfront (38%), Fenway (36%), and Downtown (34%) emerge as the primary hotspots for corporate ownership.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The data shows that corporate capital is strategically concentrating in high-density, high-rent markets where they can maximize yields from transient populations like students and young professionals.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Part 4: Equity & The Surprise</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 4: Are corporate landlords preying on vulnerable communities?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 7: The Unexpected Trend</h3>
        <img src="7.png" alt="Chart 7: The Unexpected Trend">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> To investigate the hypothesis of "predatory equity", I plotted the Minority Population % against the Corporate Ownership Rate. To my surprise, the linear trend line reveals a negative correlation. Neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of minority residents exhibit relatively lower rates of corporate ownership compared to predominantly white, wealthier districts like the Seaport.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This counter-intuitive finding supports a "Luxury Capture" model: institutional capital is aggressively competing for the most valuable, high-rent housing stock in gentrified areas. This raises a different equity concern: the systemic exclusion of working-class families from the city's most resource-rich neighborhoods.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 8: Investor Segmentation</h3>
        <img src="8.png" alt="Chart 8: Investor Segmentation">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This 100% stacked bar chart dissects corporate purchases by investor size. Institutional investors heavily dominate Longwood, the South End, Downtown, and the Seaport. In sharp contrast, working-class neighborhoods like Dorchester and Mattapan are overwhelmingly targeted by Small and Medium LLCs.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This proves there are parallel gentrification engines at work: "Institutional Expansion" in the core, and "Grassroots Speculation" by small flippers extracting rent from working-class communities in the outer boroughs.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Part 5: The Mechanism of Exclusion</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 5: Why can't ordinary families compete with corporations? Is it price or means?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 9: Luxury Capture</h3>
        <img src="9.png" alt="Chart 9: Luxury Capture">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><em>(Note: Transaction prices over $2,000,000 were filtered out to normalize the distribution view.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This box plot compares the distribution of purchase prices. A clear price premium is evident. The median purchase price for Corporate buyers is $735,000, substantially higher than the median for Individual buyers at $562,500.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This debunks the "bottom-feeding" myth. Institutional capital and LLCs are highly capitalized and are systematically outbidding ordinary families for premium properties. Ordinary individuals are losing due to a massive asymmetry in purchasing power.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 10: Cash is King</h3>
        <img src="10.png" alt="Chart 10: Cash is King">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This lollipop chart visualizes the stark difference in payment methods. Overwhelmingly, roughly 70% of Corporate purchases are executed as all-cash transactions. In sharp contrast, only about 30% of Individual buyers purchase with cash.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This is the final "fatal blow" to housing accessibility. Sellers overwhelmingly prefer "clean," all-cash offers. Corporate LLCs are weaponizing their liquidity, deploying a method of transaction that working-class families structurally cannot compete with.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 11: The "Value-Add" Hunters</h3>
        <img src="11.png" alt="Chart 11: The Value-Add Hunters">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> This distribution chart maps the percentage of purchases by building age. We observe a massive, disproportionate spike in corporate acquisitions for extremely old housing stock—specifically multi-family homes built between 1900 and 1920.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> These older buildings have historically served as Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing (NOAH). LLCs execute cosmetic renovations ("flipping") on these vintage properties to drastically upcharge rents, effectively destroying the city's affordable housing baseline.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Part 6: The Social Costs of Speculation</h2>
        <div class="research-question">
            Research Question 6: What are the broader social consequences of housing financialization on Boston's residents?
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 12: The Student Housing Machine</h3>
        <img src="12.png" alt="Chart 12: The Student Housing Machine">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Plotting the percentage of college students against corporate ownership reveals a strong positive correlation in neighborhoods like Fenway and Allston.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Capital has keenly identified Boston's student population as a lucrative cash cow. Investors convert traditional housing into high-density "student dorms," charging exorbitant rents by the bedroom. This hyper-commodification drastically raises the rent floor, pricing out local working-class residents.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 13: The Safe Deposit Box Paradox</h3>
        <img src="13.png" alt="Chart 13: The Safe Deposit Box Paradox">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Addressing the phenomenon of "Wealth Towers," this scatter plot compares vacancy rates with corporate ownership.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> A cruel paradox emerges: in highly financialized districts like the Seaport, surging corporate ownership is accompanied by alarming vacancy rates. These luxury units do not alleviate the housing shortage; they function as "Safe Deposit Boxes in the sky" for absentee owners, exposing the extreme inefficiency of speculative development.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Chart 14: The Displacement of Families</h3>
        <img src="14.png" alt="Chart 14: The Displacement of Families">
        <div class="analysis-block">
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> By tracking the percentage of the population under 18 years old against the rise of LLC ownership from 2004 to 2024, a clear negative correlation appears.</p>
            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> In neighborhoods heavily captured by corporate capital, the population of minors is experiencing a steep decline. Boston is becoming an exclusionary, "childless" investment platform, systematically displacing traditional family structures.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <h2>Summary & Policy Implications</h2>
        <p>This exploratory data analysis definitively proves that Boston's housing crisis is severely exacerbated by predatory speculative investment. Corporate capital operates through a dual mechanism: <strong>Grassroots Speculation</strong> by small LLCs using all-cash offers to hunt down historic NOAH properties, and <strong>Asset Accumulation</strong> by institutional giants building "Wealth Towers" left vacant as financial safe havens.</p>
        <p>Both mechanisms result in the displacement of ordinary families. To protect Boston's future, legislative action is urgently needed. The data strongly supports the implementation of a <strong>Local Option Transfer Fee</strong> (taxing large-scale luxury real estate sales) and mechanisms like the <strong>Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA)</strong>, empowering local residents to reclaim control of their neighborhoods.</p>
